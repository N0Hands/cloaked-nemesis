I'm an entry-level web developer in London. I love making things run smoothly&mdash;especially technology. Clarity is my goal. Read my code on [GitHub].

Before code

I come from theatre production, where I worked for the Royal Shakespeare Company, _Matilda The Musical_ and _Wicked The Musical_. After the financial crisis, I stepped up to support my father's commercial property business for two and a half years before returning to theatre. I also helped found brainstrust that has grown into a national charity for brain cancer patients and their carers.
